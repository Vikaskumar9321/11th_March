    "Margin of Error\n",

    "The margin of error (MOE) is a measure of the uncertainty or range associated with a confidence interval. It quantifies the amount by which the sample estimate (e.g., the sample mean) is likely to differ from the true population parameter. A smaller margin of error indicates a more precise estimate, while a larger margin of error suggests greater uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "The margin of error is influenced by several factors, and one of the key factors is the sample size. Specifically, the margin of error decreases as the sample size increases. This relationship is governed by the following formula for the margin of error in estimating a population mean (using the z-distribution for sufficiently large sample sizes):\n",

    "σ (sigma) is the population standard deviation.\n",
    "n is the sample size.\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you want to estimate the average income of households in a city with a 95% confidence level. You can collect data from two different sample sizes: one with a smaller sample size (1\n",
